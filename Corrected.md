User stories and tasks are often confused, but they have different purposes in project management. A user story is generally a high-level description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of an end user. They focus onÂ what the team needs to achieve, like "As a user, I want to upload photos to my profile." On the other hand, tasks are smaller and specific pieces of work we need to accomplish the user story. These tasks would be the steps that lead to the completion of the user story, such as "Design the upload button" or "Write backend code for image storage." The team breaks down the steps, and then the team is responsible for getting them done.
