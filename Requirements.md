User stories and tasks are often confused, but they have different purposes in project management. A user story is generaly a high-level description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of an end user. They focuse on what needs to be acheived, like "As a user, I want to upload photos to my profile." On the other hand, tasks are smaller, specific peices of work that need to be done to accomplish the user story. These tasks would be the steps that lead to the completion of the user story, such as "Design the upload button" or "Write backend code for image storage." The steps are broken down, and then the teamâ€™s responsible for getting them done.
